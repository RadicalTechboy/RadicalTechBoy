### About

We started our journey in 2015. And looking back it has been an awesome ride with lots of ups and downs. But whatever be the situation, we were always trying to move forward.

From 2015-2018 we focused on hardware repair and in circuit programming. Our team also managed the distribution of devices from overseas companies to our eagerly awaiting customers.

After 2018 we focused on software development. We designed a robust and reliable CMS for managing Video Recording Devices. After this great achievement our company branched out into GPS development, mobile development and CCTV + home security systems.
